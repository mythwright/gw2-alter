# GW2 Alter

A multi-account GW2 Launcher, created in Rust &amp; Tauri

## Features
- **Multi-Account**: For those alt account we know you hoard
- **Account Grouping**: Some people have different alts for different scenarios this allows you to group them and launch groups
- **Addon-Manager**: View, Install, and Update your favorite addons
  - **Manage addons per account**: Maybe you want some addons on some accounts and not on others, thanks to VFS you can pick and choose
- **Virtual Filesystem**: Sandboxes each instance of GW2 to have their own logs, configs, and addons


## Credits
* Heavy inspiration from [GW2Launcher](https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher) for so many great features
* [Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer) for the VFS idea of managing instances while keeping source clean
